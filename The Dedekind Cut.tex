\section{The Dedekind Cut}
We have successfully constructed natural numbers, integers, rationals and verified that they, along with some 
basic operations and relations such as addition and multiplication, satisfy our intuitive axioms of them (i.e. 
The basic properties of these numbers and operations, for example, the field that $(\mathbb{Q},+,\times)$ forms).
