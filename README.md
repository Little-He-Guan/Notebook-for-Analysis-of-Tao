# Notebook for Analysis of Tao
Tao's Analysis book is a good one for self-study. But one problem is, there are no *official* answers to its exercises.

*The document* (Output/Main.pdf) serves as my notebook for Tao's book, where I provide my answers to his exercises. Since the document is not only "keys to exercises", but also a notebook, it also contains my proofs to Propositions in Tao's book (They might be the same as Tao's proofs. Most of the time I write them prior to reading Tao's proofs in order to test my ability.), my own thoughts to theories in Tao's book, and so on.

For those who only want to see the answers, I provide a table of answers at the end of the document.

## How to compile
The document is written in TeX. If you want to compile the source, run pdflatex twice on Main.tex to get the output file.
